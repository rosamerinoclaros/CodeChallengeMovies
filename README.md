### MovieDB Compose App ###

A sample Android app built with Jetpack Compose that demonstrates a minimal movie browser using The Movie Database (TMDb) API.

This project was created as a code challenge. The app shows the latest/popular movies with infinite scrolling, includes a movie details screen and a search bar, and is built using Jetpack Compose.
